📝 Project Description
Resume-Parser-OpenAI-main is an AI-powered resume parser built using Python and OpenAI's language models. It helps users extract structured information from resumes (PDF format) such as name, contact details, skills, education, and experience.

This tool is especially useful for job seekers and recruiters to check if a resume is ATS-friendly (Applicant Tracking System compatible). If the app can correctly extract your details, it’s a strong sign that your resume will be understood by most hiring systems.

Whether you're building an HR tool, automating recruitment workflows, or just testing resume compatibility, this parser offers a quick and intelligent solution.
